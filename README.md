## üöÄ Overview

**acmdraws-backend** is the server-side application that powers a multiplayer drawing and guessing game inspired by skribbl.io. It handles game logic, player management, real-time communication using WebSockets, and serves game assets.

## üåü Features

- **Real-time Multiplayer**: Supports multiple players in a room.
- **Room Management**: Create public or private game rooms.
- **Game Logic**: Manages rounds, turns, word selection, drawing, guessing, and scoring.
- **WebSocket Communication**: Uses Socket.IO for real-time updates between clients and server.
- **Customizable Game Settings**: Allows hosts to configure rounds, draw time, and custom words.
- **Word Dictionary**: Includes a default dictionary and supports custom word lists.
- **Player Avatars**: Basic avatar support for players.
- **Chat Functionality**: In-game chat for players.
- **Hint System**: Provides hints during the drawing phase.
- **Server Configuration**: Allows for maintenance mode and other server-side settings.
- **Health Check Endpoint**: `/health` endpoint to monitor server status.

## üíª Tech Stack

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js.
- **Socket.IO**: Library for real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd acmdraws-backend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure the server (optional):**
    Modify `server.js` for server-specific settings in the `SERVER_CONFIG` object.

4.  **Run the server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The server will typically run on `http://localhost:3001` or the port specified in your `Procfile` or environment variables.

## üîß API Endpoints

-   `GET /health`: Returns the health status of the server.
-   `GET /api/config`: Returns the current server configuration.

## üîå WebSocket Events

The server uses Socket.IO to handle various game events. Key events include:

-   `identifyUser`: Client identifies itself to the server.
-   `createRoom`: Client requests to create a new game room.
-   `joinRoom`: Client requests to join an existing game room.
-   `startGame`: Host starts the game with specified settings.
-   `selectWord`: Drawer selects a word to draw.
-   `drawing`: Drawer sends drawing data.
-   `chatMessage`: Client sends a chat message or guess.
-   `leaveRoom`: Client leaves the current room.
-   `getPublicRooms`: Client requests a list of public rooms.
-   `clearCanvas`: Drawer clears the canvas.
